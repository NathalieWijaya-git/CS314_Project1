# CS314 Project 1: Compiler for TinyL Language
**Rutgers University - CS314**

## Project Overview
The project creates a programming environment that includes both a compiler and a virtual machine, specifically a RISC machine interpreter. The compiler implements a **recursive descent LL(1) parser** with a simple code generator, where RISC machine code is generated for expressions with “+” operations and constants. The virtual machine executes a RISC machine program, handling **READ and WRITE** instructions to interact with user input and output.
